# Progress Block

This is a mini web app with circle progress-bar for displaying on mobile devices. Progress Block consists from progress bar which displays the progress of the processes and three states with the controls of its operation: input and logic switches.

The Node.js was used as the runtime environment and the Webpack was used for building the project.

# How to compile and launch

First, you need to pre-install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or check its availability with the command:
```
node -v
```
We don't have to install the Webpack packages because we have webpack.config.js in project.


The following command will help you install the required packages:
```
npm install
```
Now you can see in your root the directory with modals - node_modules.


Finally, build and run the project:
```
npm run build
```
```
npm start
```
Webpack will collect all files into output files and put this in the new directory - dist, and the app will start on the localhost.
